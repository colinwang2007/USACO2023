# USACO2024 January Silver
The USA Computing Olympiad is a competition occuring four times a year that tests participants on coding algorithms, similar to the CCC. There are four levels of difficulty: bronze, silver, gold, and platinum.

The files in this repository are the pieces of code I used to complete the silver ranked competition in January 2024. The competition helps with understanding scenarios where different algorithms may be used. Both the pieces of code for questions one and two passed with full marks, but the third question only passed seven cases.
